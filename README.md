## General Outline

This repo is a collection of everything I did for CS-4413. It includes:

- Homework assignments and my solutions

## Additional Notes

- The grading for the course was very strange, the course was entirely HW and exams, thats it. So, (assuming nothing has changed) be sure to try your absolute best on every assignment.
   - Also all learning materials were either from the book, or from the video lectures ... watch them, they may be boring, but a lot of the assignments are literally not possible unless you watch the videos.
- Please don’t just copy or submit my work as your own. Use this as a reference to help you understand the material from the class.
- If you’re looking for more resources, the textbook is a great place to start. There are also helpful online lectures and tutorials for many of the topics covered.
